Task 01: Java WWW Client (fetching web pages using Java) 
The requirements are mentioned below. You need to write a Java program satisfying them. You are free to 
do any enhancement to the below listed requirements. 
01. Read the URL to fetch as a command line argument to your program. E.g.: 
http://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp 
02. The program assumes that all web servers run on port 80 
03. You may need to set the proxy information in your Java code, because since you are behind a 
proxy, in the same way that you define proxy details in the browser, you need to do in the Java 
program as well. 
04. Do Google / Bing It when you come across a problem. 

Task 02: Java web spider 
Now, enhance your above program to scan the “a href” html tags in your downloaded document and fetch 
the address in it. 

Eg: download all web pages linked to ‘http://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp’ so that you can see 
them from your local hard drive when no internet is present. 

Task 03: My First Java Applet 
Follow below links and make your first Java Applet and embed it in a web page. 

Note: It is optional to have the swing controls integrated. Doing it with drawstring "Hello applet!" is 
sufficient. If you can, please integrate swing controls.
